# DFDS challenge solution

## Installation and running instructions

### For project 
- create .env file (use .env.example)
- npm install 
- npm run dev

### Prisma
- npx prisma studio

## Things that I would work on/change given more time beyond the context of this task:
- Create editing functionality for voyages and units
- Be able to add more vessels
- Focus on better accessibility
- Review CrateVoyageSheet / CreateUnitSheet
- Debug or find solution for restricting types of unit in prisma schema
- Trigger closing of sheet post succesfull submit (? - depending on user feedback and dashboard usage)
